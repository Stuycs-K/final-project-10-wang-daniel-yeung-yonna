## Instructions

# Java code:
The java code works using makefile. <br />
The alphabets that you put into the encoder and decoder should be 26 letters with no repeating letters. <br />
Encoder encrypts the plaintext. <br />
make Encoder ARGS="LeftAlphabet RightAlphabet PlainText" prints out the encoded text. <br />
make Decoder ARGS="LeftAlphabet RightAlphabet EncodedText" prints out the decoded text. <br />

# Processing code:
1. The processing code works by clicking the play button. <br />
When the processing runs it defualts with two disks spinning in its original alphabet.<br />
2. Pressing "Q" on the keyboard would pause the wheel at specific plaintext letter. <br />
3. Pressing "C" on the keyboard would change the letters of the wheel after permutating the left and right disks based on the Zenith at letter "B" on the left disk and "C" on the right disk. <br />
4. Pressing "A" on the keyboard would change the letters of the wheel after permutating the left and right disks based on the Zenith at letter "P" on the left disk and "A" on the right disk. <br />
