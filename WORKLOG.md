### May 24th
Started Sketch for processing and made the circle for the wheel.
### May 25th
Added letters in each of the 26 sections of the wheel in the order of the alphabet.
### May 27th
Made the right circle one section offset to the left one so it looks like it is interlocking with each other. Drew notches on each section and added the correct letters of chaocipher into each section.
### May 28th
Horiozontally flipped the right letters since the circles are turning opposite ways. Moved each letter one section ahead so it matched with the Zenith point. Added "Zenith" and "Nadir onto the circles.
### May 30th
Trying to figure out how the radian and degree function work in processing for my arrows to point up and down. had to restore some functions cause i did something stupid wtih resetting commits.
