## Yonna Yeung

### May 24th
Started Sketch for processing and made the circle for the wheel.
### May 25th
Added letters in each of the 26 sections of the wheel in the order of the alphabet.
### May 27th
Made the right circle one section offset to the left one so it looks like it is interlocking with each other. Drew notches on each section and added the correct letters of chaocipher into each section.
### May 28th
Horiozontally flipped the right letters since the circles are turning opposite ways. Moved each letter one section ahead so it matched with the Zenith point. Added "Zenith" and "Nadir onto the circles.
### May 30th
Trying to figure out how the radian and degree function work in processing for my arrows to point up and down. had to restore some functions cause i did something stupid wtih resetting commits.
### May 31th
Fixed the title on the right circle because it is supposed to match perfectly. I tried to make the notches on the right circle in between the sections but need to figure out how to remove the original one, Ended up just creating a new function.
### Jun 3rd
Fixed letters in the wheel to match and fixed notches.
### Jun 4th
Fixed the function names for each circle. I had the left and right drawcircles reversed.
### Jun 5th
Made a function that would pause when the keybpressed. 
### June 9th
Continued on the keypressed functions. Pressing Q would make the original stop. Pressing C would permutate the first set of letters and then find letter A. Presseing A would permutate the set of letters the second time and find the letter T. 
### June 10th
Created the google slides and did more orgnaizing with the files and also filmed the video. Finalized the code.
