# The Chaocipher's History
John F. Byrne was born in Ireland in 1880, and he had the idea to create a cipher in 1918, after moving to New York to become a writer. <br />This cipher was called the Chaocipher, which he tried selling from 1918 to 1953 to the government to no avail. Funnily enough, this cipher was actually impossible to crack, being unsolved for half a century and also being small enough to fit inside a cigar box. The only reason he couldn't sell the cipher was due to his way of disclosing the information to the government in his attempts to sell it. He just refused to send the full details of his cipher to the government due to him not being a cryptanalyst, always saying that his 1 of 169

BPJcipher was indecipherable. This caused him to never be able to sell the cipher and instead in 1953, he created his autobiography, Silent Years. In this book, he included examples of enciphered texts such as the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address to give the reader examples of ciphertext and plaintext pairs. He wanted people to try and figure out how his cipher worked. His cipher's inner mechanism was never figured out, but in 2010, the chaocipher's inner workings were revealed by Patricia Byrne, John Byrne’s son’s widow.

# How the Chaocipher Works
Left Alphabet:  BAZOMLYXITSRQDEPCNKJWHUGVF <br />
Right Alphabet: CKIWLHGFESDQBNZYAXJVUTRPOM <br />
Plain Text: CAT <br />
Step 1: <br />
Make sure the left and right disks are engaged. <br />

//Photo of the chaocipher just not moving

AS you can see, the left disk is read from left to right while the right disk is read from right to left. Both start at the zenith. <br />

Step 2: <br />
Rotate the right disk counter clockwise until the zenith (top of the disk) is "C", the first letter in the cipher. <br />

//Photo of the chaocipher with C at the zenith

Rotating the right disk has also rotated the left disk as well. <br />
This letter on the left disk's zenith is the encoded text's first letter. <br />

Step 3: <br />
Permutate the left alphabet: BAZOMLYXITSRQDEPCNKJWHUGVF
