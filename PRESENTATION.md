# The Chaocipher's History
John F. Byrne was born in Ireland in 1880, and he had the idea to create a cipher in 1918, after moving to New York to become a writer. <br />This cipher was called the chaocipher, which he tried selling from 1918 to 1953 to the government to no avail. Funnily enough, this cipher was actually impossible to crack, being unsolved for half a century and also being small enough to fit inside a cigar box. The only reason he couldn't sell the cipher was due to his way of disclosing the information to the government in his attempts to sell it. He just refused to send the full details of his cipher to the government due to him not being a cryptanalyst, always saying that his cipher was indecipherable. This caused him to never be able to sell the cipher and instead in 1953, he created his autobiography, Silent Years. In this book, he included examples of enciphered texts such as the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address to give the reader examples of ciphertext and plaintext pairs. He wanted people to try and figure out how his cipher worked. His cipher's inner mechanism was never figured out, but in 2010, the chaocipher's inner workings were revealed by Patricia Byrne, John Byrne’s son’s widow.
